          h1. Deliverables
          The power domain protocol is intended for management of power states of power domains. The power domain management protocol provides commands to:
          * Describe the protocol version.
          * Discover implementation attributes.
          * Set the power state of a domain.
          * Get the current power state of a domain.
          * Optionally get notifications when power domains change state or when an agent requests for a power domain state change.
          * Optionally return statistics on residency and usage count of a given power state.

          In OP-TEE in S-EL (TEE core) we will need to implement a SCMI agent (client) that can request for power domain state changes.
          {color:red}
          Question to Etienne, will the power domain agent also need to get notifications on power domain state changes?
          {color}

          h1. Out of Scope
          This card is only about adding a client to OP-TEE, i.e., S-EL1 (and not TF-A, EL3).

          h1. Risks and Assumptions
          Assumptions: possible to implement this as a standalone

          h1. Deliverables
          The performance domain management (protocol) is intended for performance management of groups of devices or APs that run in the same performance domain. A performance domain is defined by a set of devices that always have to run at the same performance level. For a given performance domain, there is a single point of control that affects all the devices in the domain, making it impossible to set the performance level of an individual device in the domain independently from other devices in that domain. For example, a set of CPUs that share a voltage domain, and have a common frequency control, is said to be in the same performance domain. The commands in this protocol provide functionality to:
          * Describe the protocol version.
          * Describe attribute flags of the protocol.
          * Set the performance level of a domain.
          * Read the current performance level of a domain.
          * Return the list of performance levels supported by a performance domain, and the properties of each performance level.
          * Optionally return statistics on residency and usage count of a performance level in performance domains.

          In OP-TEE (TEE core) we will need to implement a SCMI agent (client) that can manage performance domains.

          h1. Out of Scope
          This card is only about adding a client to OP-TEE (TEE core). I.e., other boot binaries, boot loaders are not part of this Epic.

          h1. Risks and Assumptions
          Assumptions: possible to implement this as a standalone component.

          h1. Deliverables
          This Epic is about implementing support for a subset of the [Elliptic curve mechanisms|http://docs.oasis-open.org/pkcs11/pkcs11-curr/v2.40/os/pkcs11-curr-v2.40-os.html#_Toc416960009] defined by PKCS#11. By subset we have tried identify the most commonly used mechanisms. The list of PKCS#11 mechanisms that we intend to implement in this Epic are:
          * CKM_EC_KEY_PAIR_GEN (CKM_ECDSA_KEY_PAIR_GEN)
          * CKM_ECDSA
          * CKM_ECDSA_SHA1
          * CKM_ECDH1_DERIVE

          Note that this depends on [SWG-XYZ] (PKCS#11 - Signature and MAC functions).

          For most functions mentioned here, we need to write code in optee_os, optee_client and optee_test. I.e., these functions are called on the client side, but in most cases there is a 1:1 mapping to a function on secure side also (as a service in a Trusted Application).

          h1. Out of Scope
          Following Elliptic curve mechanisms are not considered in this card.
          * CKM_ECDH1_COFACTOR_DERIVE
          * CKM_ECMQV_DERIVE
          * CKM_ECDH_AES_KEY_WRAP

          h1. Risks and Assumptions
          Assumptions: possible to implement this as a standalone component.

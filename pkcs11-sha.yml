          h1. Deliverables
          This Epic is about implementing support for the SHA mechanisms in PKCS#11, i.e., in short make it possible to compute plain and normal SHA hashes. The list of PKCS#11 mechanisms that we intend to implement in this Epic are:
          * CKM_SHA_1 (done in [SWG-XYZ], generic digest functions)
          * CKM_SHA224
          * CKM_SHA256
          * CKM_SHA384
          * CKM_SHA512

          Note that this depends on [SWG-XYZ] (PKCS#11 - Digest functions).

          For most functions mentioned here, we need to write code in optee_os, optee_client and optee_test. I.e., these functions are called on the client side, but in most cases there is a 1:1 mapping to a function on secure side also (as a service in a Trusted Application).

          h1. Out of Scope
          * This work doesn't include HMAC (dealth with in separate Epics).
          * This work doesn't include/involve RSA where hashes are used (also separate Epics).

          h1. Risks and Assumptions
          Assumptions: possible to implement this as a standalone component.

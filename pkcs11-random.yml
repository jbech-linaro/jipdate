epic_name: PKCS#11 - Random number generation function

          h1. Deliverables
          This Epic is about implementing the functions used to generate random numbers in PKCS#11. The list of PKCS#11 functions that we intend to implement in this Epic are:
          * C_SeedRandom, mixes in additional seed material to the random number generator
          * C_GenerateRandom, generates random data

          For most functions mentioned here, we need to write code in optee_os, optee_client and optee_test. I.e., these functions are called on the client side, but in most cases there is a 1:1 mapping to a function on secure side also (as a service in a Trusted Application).

          h1. Out of Scope
          N/A

          h1. Risks and Assumptions
          Assumptions: possible to implement this as a standalone component.

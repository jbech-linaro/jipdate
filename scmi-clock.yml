epic_name: SCMI - Clock management agent in OP-TEE
description:

          h1. Deliverables
          The clock management (protocol) is intended for management of clocks. It is used to enable or disable clocks, and to set rates. The protocol provides commands to:
          * Describe the protocol version.
          * Discover implementation attributes.
          * Describe a clock.
          * Enable or disable a clock.
          * Set the rate of the clock synchronously or asynchronously.

          In OP-TEE (TEE core) we will need to implement a SCMI agent (client) that can manage clock rates.

          h1. Out of Scope
          This card is only about adding a client to OP-TEE (TEE core). I.e., other boot binaries, boot loaders are not part of this Epic.

          h1. Risks and Assumptions
          Assumptions: possible to implement this as a standalone component.

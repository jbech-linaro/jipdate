          h1. Deliverables
          This Epic is about implementing support for the SHA based mechanisms used to derive keys in PKCS#11. SHA-xyz key derivation, denoted CKM_SHAxyz_KEY_DERIVATION, is a mechanism which provides the capability of deriving a secret key by digesting the value of another secret key with SHA-xyz. The list of PKCS#11 mechanisms that we intend to implement in this Epic are:
          * CKM_SHA1_KEY_DERIVATION
          * CKM_SHA224_KEY_DERIVATION
          * CKM_SHA256_KEY_DERIVATION
          * CKM_SHA384_KEY_DERIVATION
          * CKM_SHA512_KEY_DERIVATION

          Note that this depends on [SWG-XYZ] (PKCS#11 - Digest functions).

          For most functions mentioned here, we need to write code in optee_os, optee_client and optee_test. I.e., these functions are called on the client side, but in most cases there is a 1:1 mapping to a function on secure side also (as a service in a Trusted Application).

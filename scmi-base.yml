summary: SCMI - base protocol in OP-TEE
epic_name: SCMI - base protocol in OP-TEE
description:
        - |
          h1. Deliverables
          The base protocol describes the properties of the implementation and provides generic error management. The Base protocol provides commands to:
          * Describe protocol version.
          * Discover implementation attributes and vendor identification.
          * Discover which protocols are implemented.
          * Discover which agents are in the system.
          * Register for notifications of platform errors.
          * Configure the platform in order to control and modify an agentâ€™s visibility of platform resources and commands.

          In OP-TEE (TEE core) we will need to implement a SCMI agent (client) that supports the mandatory base protocol functions.

          h1. Out of Scope
          This card is only about adding a client to OP-TEE (TEE core). I.e., other boot binaries, boot loaders are not part of this Epic.

          h1. Risks and Assumptions
          Assumptions: possible to implement this as a standalone component.

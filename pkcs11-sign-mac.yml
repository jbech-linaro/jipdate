          h1. Deliverables
          This Epic is about implementing the signature and MAC functions in OP-TEE as described in the PKCS#11 API. The list of PKCS#11 functions that we intend to implement in this Epic are:
          * C_Sign(), signs single-part data
          * C_SignInit(), initializes a signature operation
          * C_SignUpdate(), continues a multiple-part signature operation
          * C_SignFinal(), finishes a multiple-part signature operation
          * C_Verify(), verifies a signature on single-part data
          * C_VerifyInit(), initializes a verification operation
          * C_VerifyUpdate(), continues a multiple-part verification operation
          * C_VerifyFinal(), finishes a multiple-part verification operation

          Since this is about writing the boilerplate code for the functions we will simply just use [CKM_SHA256_HMAC|http://docs.oasis-open.org/pkcs11/pkcs11-curr/v2.40/cs01/pkcs11-curr-v2.40-cs01.html#_Toc399398983] when writing this Epic. For other mechanisms, please see the comment in the "Out of Scope" section further down.

          For most functions mentioned here, we need to write code in optee_os, optee_client and optee_test. I.e., these functions are called on the client side, but in most cases there is a 1:1 mapping to a function on secure side also (as a service in a Trusted Application).

          h1. Out of Scope
          * C_SignRecoverInit, initializes a signature operation, where the data can be recovered from the signature
          * C_SignRecover, signs single-part data, where the data can be recovered from the signature
          * C_VerifyRecoverInit, initializes a verification operation where the data is recovered from the signature
          * C_VerifyRecover, verifies a signature on single-part data, where the data is recovered from the signature

          This is about adding the boilerplate code for the signature and MAC functions. Note that there are several mechanisms that can be provided as parameters. I.e., depending on the parameter you can generate and verify signatures and MACs using different signature algorithms. This card is not about adding support for all these mechanisms. Support for that will be done in separate Epics.

          h1. Risks and Assumptions
          Assumptions: possible to implement this as a standalone component.

description:
        - |
          h1. Deliverables
          The sensor management (protocol) is intended to manage platform sensors, and provides the following commands:
          * Describe the protocol version.
          * Describe the attribute flags of the protocol.
          * Discover sensors that are implemented and managed by the platform.
          * Read a sensor synchronously or asynchronously as allowed by the platform.
          * Obtain and program sensor attributes, if applicable.
          * Receive notifications on specific changes to sensor data, for example when a sensor value crosses a threshold.
          * Specify a region of shared memory for conveying sensor values, if supported by the platform.

          In OP-TEE (TEE core) we will need to implement a SCMI agent (client) that can manage sensors.

          h1. Out of Scope
          This card is only about adding a client to OP-TEE (TEE core). I.e., other boot binaries, boot loaders are not part of this Epic.

          h1. Risks and Assumptions
          Assumptions: possible to implement this as a standalone component.

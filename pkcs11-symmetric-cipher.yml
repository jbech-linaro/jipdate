          h1. Deliverables
          This Epic is about implementing the symmetric cipher functions in OP-TEE as described in the PKCS#11 API. The list of PKCS#11 functions that we intend to implement in this Epic are:
          * C_Encrypt, encrypts single-part data
          * C_EncryptInit(), initializes an encryption operation
          * C_EncryptUpdate(), continues a multiple-part encryption operation
          * C_EncryptFinal(), finishes a multiple-part encryption operation
          * C_Decrypt, decrypts single-part encrypted data
          * C_DecryptInit(), initializes a decryption operation
          * C_DecryptUpdate(), continues a multiple-part decryption operation
          * C_DecryptFinal(), finishes a multiple-part decryption operation

          Since this is about writing the boilerplate code for the functions we will simply just use [CKM_AES_ECB|http://docs.oasis-open.org/pkcs11/pkcs11-curr/v2.40/csprd02/pkcs11-curr-v2.40-csprd02.html#_Toc387327808] when writing this Epic. For other mechanisms, please see the comment in the "Out of Scope" section further down.

          For most functions mentioned here, we need to write code in optee_os, optee_client and optee_test. I.e., these functions are called on the client side, but in most cases there is a 1:1 mapping to a function on secure side also (as a service in a Trusted Application).

          h1. Out of Scope
          This is about adding the boilerplate code for the symmetric cipher functions. Note that there are several mechanisms that can be provided as parameters. I.e., depending on the parameter you can run different ciphers and modes. This card is not about supporting all ciphers and modes. Support for that will be done in separate Epics.

          h1. Risks and Assumptions
          Assumptions: possible to implement this as a standalone component.
